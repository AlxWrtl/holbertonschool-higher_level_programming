# Python Object and Variable Interaction Project

## Background Context

In this project, we delve deep into Python's core concept that everything is an object. With our foundational knowledge, we take a moment to closely examine Python's interactions with different types of objects. Through exploration and questioning, we aim to understand the nuanced behaviors of Python variables and objects, especially in scenarios that may not behave as initially expected.

### Understanding Variable References and Mutability

Have you ever found yourself modifying a variable unintentionally? Consider these examples:

```python
a = 1
b = a
a = 2
print(b)
```

Versus:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
m = l
l[0] = 'x'
print(m)
```

The outcomes highlight Python's variable reference behavior and mutability concepts, which are central to this project's learning goals.

### Project Overview

This project takes a unique approach compared to typical programming assignments. The initial phase comprises theoretical questions about Python's specificity, such as "What would be the result of...".

### Objectives

- Deepen your understanding of how Python manages variable references and object mutability.
- Develop critical thinking skills in predicting the behavior of Python code.
- Prepare for technical interviews by mastering common questions related to Python's object and variable handling.
