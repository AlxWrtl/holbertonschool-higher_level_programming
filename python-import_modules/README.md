# Python Calculator and Utilities

## Description

This project provides a collection of simple Python scripts demonstrating basic programming concepts. Each script performs a specific task, such as arithmetic operations, argument handling, or accessing variables from different modules. The project serves as an educational tool for beginners learning Python and system-level programming.

### Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to provide clear, concise examples of fundamental Python concepts such as importing modules, handling command-line arguments, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Problem Solved

These scripts collectively demonstrate simple yet fundamental programming tasks in Python, aiding in understanding how to manipulate data, use functions, and interact with the command line.

### Learnings

This project highlights the importance of understanding basic programming concepts such as function definition and invocation, command-line argument parsing, and module usage in Python.

## üóÇÔ∏è Files

- `0-add.py`: Demonstrates basic addition operation.
- `1-calculation.py`: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- `2-args.py`: Handles command-line arguments and displays them.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: Adds an indefinite number of command-line arguments.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: Lists names in a module that do not start with '__'.
- `5-variable_load.py`: Imports and prints a variable from another module.

## Installation

To use these scripts:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`

## Usage

Each script can be run directly from the command line. For example:

1. Run `python3 0-add.py` to execute the addition script.

### Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Handling of command-line arguments.
- Importing and using variables from different Python modules.
