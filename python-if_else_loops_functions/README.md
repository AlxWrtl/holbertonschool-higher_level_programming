# Simple Python Scripts

## Description

This repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts that perform various tasks. These scripts were created to demonstrate basic programming concepts and solve specific problems.

### Motivation

The primary motivation behind creating these scripts was to practice Python programming and gain a better understanding of fundamental programming constructs.

### Problem Solved

These scripts address a variety of problems, from working with random numbers to performing basic string manipulations and mathematical operations.

### Learnings

Through working on these scripts, we have improved our Python programming skills and learned how to solve common programming challenges.

## üóÇÔ∏è Scripts

Here is a list of the Python scripts available in this repository:

### 0-positive_or_negative.py

This script generates a random number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1-last_digit.py

This script generates a random number and extracts its last digit. It then checks if the last digit is greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6.

### 2-print_alphabet.py

This script prints the lowercase alphabet in ascending order.

### 3-print_alphabt.py

This script also prints the lowercase alphabet in ascending order but excludes the letters 'q' and 'e'.

### 4-print_hexa.py

This script prints the hexadecimal representation of numbers from 0 to 98.

### 5-print_comb2.py

This script prints pairs of two-digit numbers from 00 to 99, separated by commas.

### 6-print_comb3.py

This script prints all possible combinations of two different digits from 0 to 9 in ascending order, separated by commas.

### 7-islower.py

This script defines a function `islower(c)` that checks whether a given character is a lowercase letter (a to z).

### 8-uppercase.py

This script defines a function `uppercase(str)` that converts all lowercase letters in a given string to uppercase.

### 9-print_last_digit.py

This script defines a function `print_last_digit(number)` that prints the last digit of a given number.

### 10-add.py

This script defines a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.

### 11-pow.py

This script defines a function `pow(a, b)` that calculates the result of raising `a` to the power of `b`.

### 12-fizzbuzz.py

This script implements the FizzBuzz game, where it prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz," for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz," and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."

## Usage

To use these scripts, you can follow the instructions provided within each script's code. Most of them are designed to be run as standalone Python scripts and provide instructions on how to execute them.
